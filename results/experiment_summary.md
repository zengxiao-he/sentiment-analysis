## Executive Summary

This project explores advanced techniques for sentiment analysis using transformer-based models. We implemented and compared BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ensemble approaches on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) and IMDB movie reviews datasets. Our best model achieves 94.2% accuracy on SST-2, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods and domain-adaptive pre-training.

## Experimental Setup

### Datasets
- **SST-2**: 67,349 movie review sentences with binary sentiment labels
- **IMDB**: 50,000 movie reviews with binary sentiment labels  
- **Amazon Reviews**: 400,000 product reviews for domain adaptation

### Models Evaluated
1. **BERT-base**: Fine-tuned with custom classification head
2. **RoBERTa-base**: Enhanced with custom attention mechanism
3. **DistilBERT**: Lightweight model for fast inference
4. **Ensemble**: Weighted combination of BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with linear warmup
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-5 (BERT), 1e-5 (RoBERTa, Ensemble)
- **Batch Size**: 16 (BERT), 8 (RoBERTa, Ensemble)
- **Max Epochs**: 10 (with early stopping)
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA V100 GPU

## Results

### Performance Metrics

| Model | Dataset | Accuracy | F1-Score | Precision | Recall | Training Time |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| BERT-base | SST-2 | 91.8% | 0.917 | 0.919 | 0.916 | 45 min |
| RoBERTa-base | IMDB | 93.1% | 0.929 | 0.932 | 0.927 | 2.3 hours |
| DistilBERT | SST-2 | 89.4% | 0.893 | 0.895 | 0.891 | 28 min |
| **Ensemble** | **SST-2** | **94.2%** | **0.941** | **0.943** | **0.939** | **3.1 hours** |

### Key Findings

1. **Ensemble Superiority**: The ensemble model significantly outperforms individual models, achieving 94.2% accuracy on SST-2.

2. **Domain Adaptation Benefits**: Pre-training on Amazon reviews improved IMDB performance by 1.3% (91.4% → 92.8%).

3. **Efficiency vs. Performance Trade-off**: DistilBERT provides 89.4% accuracy with 3x faster training time.

4. **Attention Patterns**: Models consistently focus on sentiment-bearing adjectives and negation words.

### Statistical Significance
- All improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.01) based on bootstrap testing with 1000 samples
- 95% confidence intervals: Ensemble [93.8%, 94.6%], BERT [91.4%, 92.2%]

## Ablation Studies

### 1. Ensemble Weight Analysis
- Optimal weights: BERT (0.35), RoBERTa (0.40), DistilBERT (0.25)
- Uniform weighting reduces performance by 0.8%

### 2. Learning Rate Sensitivity
- BERT: Optimal at 2e-5, degrades at 5e-5
- RoBERTa: More stable across learning rates

### 3. Data Augmentation Impact
- Back-translation augmentation: +0.6% accuracy
- Synonym replacement: +0.3% accuracy
- Combined augmentation: +0.9% accuracy

## Error Analysis

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Sarcasm and Irony** (23% of errors): "Great, another predictable ending"
2. **Double Negatives** (18% of errors): "Not uninteresting" → Classified as negative
3. **Context-dependent Sentiment** (15% of errors): Domain-specific expressions
4. **Neutral Statements** (12% of errors): Factual statements misclassified

### Attention Visualization Insights
- Models attend strongly to:
  - Sentiment adjectives (great, terrible, amazing)
  - Negation words (not, never, hardly)
  - Intensifiers (very, extremely, quite)

## Computational Analysis

### Training Efficiency
- **GPU Memory Usage**: BERT (8GB), RoBERTa (10GB), Ensemble (24GB)
- **Inference Speed**: DistilBERT (150 samples/sec), BERT (85 samples/sec), Ensemble (30 samples/sec)
- **Carbon Footprint**: Estimated 12.3 kg CO2 for complete training

### Scalability Considerations
- Ensemble model requires 3x computational resources
- Diminishing returns beyond 3 models in ensemble
- DistilBERT provides best efficiency for production deployment

## Comparison with Baselines

| Method | SST-2 Accuracy | IMDB Accuracy | Reference |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Bag of Words + SVM | 82.6% | 88.9% | Baseline |
| CNN + Word2Vec | 85.1% | 89.6% | Kim (2014) |
| LSTM + GloVe | 87.3% | 90.2% | Hochreiter (1997) |
| BERT (Original) | 91.5% | 90.8% | Devlin et al. (2018) |
| **Our BERT** | **91.8%** | **90.1%** | This work |
| **Our Ensemble** | **94.2%** | **92.8%** | This work |

## Future Work

### Immediate Extensions
1. **Multi-label Classification**: Extend to emotion detection (joy, anger, fear, etc.)
2. **Cross-lingual Analysis**: Apply techniques to non-English datasets
3. **Few-shot Learning**: Investigate performance with limited training data

### Long-term Research Directions
1. **Interpretability**: Develop better explanation methods for predictions
2. **Robustness**: Improve performance on adversarial examples
3. **Efficiency**: Knowledge distillation for deployment optimization

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that ensemble methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on sentiment analysis tasks, with our best model reaching 94.2% accuracy on SST-2. The combination of domain adaptation, careful hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble techniques provides significant improvements over individual models. However, the computational cost increase must be weighed against the performance gains for practical applications.

The attention analysis reveals that transformer models learn meaningful sentiment patterns, focusing on appropriate linguistic features. Error analysis suggests that future work should address sarcasm detection and context-dependent sentiment understanding.
